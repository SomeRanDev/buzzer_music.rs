# buzzer_music for Rust!

Plays music on piezo/passive buzzers with the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) programming language (using [Embassy](https://embassy.dev/)). This is a port of @james1236's [buzzer_music](https://github.com/james1236/buzzer_music) for Micropython. As the original project states, this replaces chords with fast arpeggios to simulate polyphony with a single buzzer. Music can be created using https://onlinesequencer.net
